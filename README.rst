FixedPointInverseDeformationField takes a deformation field as input and
computes the deformation field that is its inverse. If the input deformation
field was mapping coordinates from a space A into a space B, the output of
this filter will map coordinates from the space B into the space A.

The fixed point algorithm is described in the paper::

  Mingli Chen, Weiguo Lu, Quan Chen, Knneth J. Ruchala and Gusavo H. Olivera "A simple fixed-point approach to invert a deformation field",
    Medical Physics, vol. 35, issue 1, p. 81,

The FixedPointInverseDeformationFieldImageFilter has been implemented and described in the Insight Journal article::

Since ITK 4.10.0, this module is available in the ITK source tree as a Remote
module.  To enable it, set::

  Module_FixedPointInverseDeformationField:BOOL=ON

in ITK's CMake build configuration.
